Templates are production-ready codebases that you can clone and build on top of. Each template includes AgentOS, PostgreSQL, and deployment scripts for your target platform.

## Choose Your Template

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Docker" icon="docker" href="/production/templates/docker">
    Run AgentOS locally using Docker.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Railway" icon="train" href="/production/templates/railway">
    Deploy AgentOS to Railway.
  </Card>
  <Card title="AWS" icon="aws" href="/production/templates/aws">
    Deploy AgentOS to ECS.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

| Template | Best For | Time |
|----------|----------|------|
| [Docker](/production/templates/docker) | Local development, testing, self-hosting | ~5 min |
| [Railway](/production/templates/railway) | Quick production deployments, MVPs | ~10 min |
| [AWS](/production/templates/aws) | Production at scale, enterprise | ~15 min |

## Which Template Should I Use?

**Docker** if you want to develop locally, self-host, or deploy to any cloud that supports Docker.

**Railway** if you want to ship quickly without managing infrastructure.

**AWS** if you need production-grade reliability and enterprise controls.

## Prerequisites

All templates require:
- [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- An API key from a model provider

AWS additionally requires:
- AWS CLI configured with credentials
