This template deploys AgentOS and PostgreSQL with pgvector to Railway. Automatic HTTPS and public domain included.

## Step-by-step Guide

<Steps>
<Step title="Install tools">

- Install [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/)
- Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (Python package manager)
- Install the [Railway CLI](https://docs.railway.com/guides/cli):

<CodeGroup>
```bash Mac
brew install railway
```
```bash Windows/Linux
npm install -g @railway/cli
```
</CodeGroup>

</Step>

<Step title="Create and activate a virtual environment">

```bash
uv venv --python 3.12
source .venv/bin/activate
```

</Step>

<Step title="Install Agno">

```bash
uv pip install -U 'agno[infra]'
```

</Step>

<Step title="Create your codebase">

```bash
ag infra create --template agentos-railway --name agentos-railway

cd agentos-railway
```

<Tip>
Or clone directly: `git clone https://github.com/agno-agi/agentos-railway-template.git`
</Tip>

</Step>

<Step title="Export your API key">

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-***
```

<Tip>
Agno works with any model provider. Just update the agents in your codebase.
</Tip>

</Step>

<Step title="Test locally (optional)">

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

Open http://localhost:8000/docs to verify it works, then stop with `docker compose down`.

</Step>

<Step title="Login to Railway">

```bash
railway login
```

</Step>

<Step title="Deploy to Railway">

```bash
./scripts/railway_up.sh
```

This creates the Railway project, provisions the database, and deploys your AgentOS.

</Step>

<Step title="Get your domain">

```bash
railway open
```

Find your domain in the Railway dashboard (e.g., `https://your-app.railway.app`). Navigate to `<railway-domain>/docs` to see your AgentOS API.

</Step>

<Step title="Connect your AgentOS to the control plane">

1. Open [os.agno.com](https://os.agno.com)
2. Click "Connect OS" and select "Live"
3. Enter your Railway domain as the endpoint

## Tips

**Update deployment**: After making changes to your agents:
```bash
railway up --service agent_os -d
```

**View logs**:
```bash
railway logs --service agent_os
```

**Stop deployment**:
```bash
railway down --service agent_os
railway down --service pgvector
```

**Project structure:**
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Deployment fails">
    Check the Railway logs:
```bash
    railway logs --service agent_os
```
    Common issues: missing environment variables, Docker build errors.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Database connection timeout">
    Railway's PostgreSQL may take a moment to provision. Wait 30 seconds and retry.
