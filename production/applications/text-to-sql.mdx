---

A self-learning SQL agent that queries Formula 1 data (1950-2020) and improves through accumulated knowledge. Customize and connect it to your own data to build a powerful text-to-SQL agent.

## What Makes This Different

Most Text-to-SQL tutorials show you how to generate SQL from natural language. This one goes further:

1. **Knowledge-Based Query Generation**: The agent searches a knowledge base before writing SQL, ensuring consistent patterns
2. **Data Quality Handling**: Instead of cleaning messy data, the agent learns to handle inconsistencies (mixed types, date formats, naming conventions)
3. **Self-Learning Loop**: Users can save validated queries, which the agent retrieves for similar future questions

## What You'll Learn

| Concept | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| **Semantic Model** | Define table metadata to guide query generation |
| **Knowledge Base** | Store and retrieve query patterns and data quality notes |
| **Data Quality Handling** | Handle type mismatches and inconsistencies without ETL |
| **Self-Learning** | Save validated queries to improve future responses |
| **Agentic Memory** | Remember user preferences across sessions |

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- Docker (for PostgreSQL with pgvector)
- OpenAI API key

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step title="Clone the repository">

```bash
git clone https://github.com/agno-agi/agno.git
cd agno
```

</Step>

<Step title="Create and activate virtual environment">

```bash
uv venv .venvs/text-to-sql --python 3.12
source .venvs/text-to-sql/bin/activate
```

</Step>

<Step title="Install dependencies">

```bash
uv pip install -r cookbook/01_showcase/01_agents/text_to_sql/requirements.in
```

</Step>

<Step title="Set environment variables">

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key
```

</Step>

<Step title="Start PostgreSQL with pgvector">

```bash
./cookbook/scripts/run_pgvector.sh
```

This starts a PostgreSQL container with pgvector on port 5532.

</Step>

<Step title="Check setup">

```bash
python cookbook/01_showcase/01_agents/text_to_sql/scripts/check_setup.py
```

</Step>

<Step title="Load F1 data and knowledge base">

```bash
python cookbook/01_showcase/01_agents/text_to_sql/scripts/load_f1_data.py
python cookbook/01_showcase/01_agents/text_to_sql/scripts/load_knowledge.py
```

</Step>
</Steps>

## Run the Agent

### Basic Queries

Run simple aggregation and filtering queries:

```bash
python cookbook/01_showcase/01_agents/text_to_sql/examples/basic_queries.py
```

Demonstrates:
- Simple aggregation queries (counts, sums)
- Filtering by year or driver
- Using the semantic model to find relevant tables

### Self-Learning Loop

See how the agent saves validated queries to improve:

```bash
python cookbook/01_showcase/01_agents/text_to_sql/examples/learning_loop.py
```

Demonstrates:
- Query execution and validation
- Saving queries to the knowledge base
- How saved queries improve future responses

### Edge Cases

Test complex queries and error handling:

```bash
python cookbook/01_showcase/01_agents/text_to_sql/examples/edge_cases.py
```

### Evaluate Accuracy

Run automated accuracy testing:

```bash
python cookbook/01_showcase/01_agents/text_to_sql/examples/evaluate.py
```

## Agent Configuration

```python
sql_agent = Agent(
    name="SQL Agent",
    model=OpenAIResponses(id="gpt-5.2"),
    db=sql_agent_db,
    knowledge=sql_agent_knowledge,
    system_message=system_message,
    tools=[
        SQLTools(db_url=DB_URL),
        ReasoningTools(add_instructions=True),
        save_validated_query,
    ],
    add_datetime_to_context=True,
    enable_agentic_memory=True,
    search_knowledge=True,
    add_history_to_context=True,
    num_history_runs=5,
    read_chat_history=True,
    read_tool_call_history=True,
    markdown=True,
)
```

| Parameter | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `model` | GPT-5.2 for query generation and reasoning |
| `db` | PostgreSQL connection for query execution |
| `knowledge` | Vector database storing query patterns and table metadata |
| `SQLTools` | Execute SQL queries against the database |
| `ReasoningTools` | Think step-by-step before query construction |
| `save_validated_query` | Custom tool to persist successful queries |
| `enable_agentic_memory` | Remember user preferences across sessions |
| `search_knowledge` | Search knowledge base before writing SQL |
| `add_history_to_context` | Include recent conversation for context |

## How It Works

### Query Workflow

```
1. User asks a question
2. Agent searches knowledge base for similar queries
3. Agent identifies tables from semantic model
4. Agent constructs and executes SQL
5. Agent validates results and presents answer
6. Agent offers to save the query for future use
```

### Knowledge Base

The knowledge base stores three types of information:

| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Table metadata | Column names, types, and descriptions |
| Query patterns | Reusable SQL patterns for common operations |
| Validated queries | User-approved queries saved for retrieval |

### Semantic Model

The semantic model provides high-level context about available tables:

```python
{
    "tables": [
        {
            "table_name": "drivers_championship",
            "table_description": "Driver championship standings (1950 to 2020).",
            "use_cases": [
                "Driver standings by year",
                "Comparing driver points across seasons"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

### Self-Learning Loop

1. Agent executes a query and validates results
2. Agent asks: "Would you like to save this query?"
3. If confirmed, stores the question, SQL, and explanation
4. Future similar questions retrieve this pattern automatically

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Database connection refused">
    Ensure PostgreSQL is running:
    ```bash
    docker ps | grep pgvector
    ```
    If not running:
    ```bash
    ./cookbook/scripts/run_pgvector.sh
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Query returns wrong results for position">
    The `position` column in `drivers_championship` is TEXT, not INT. Use string comparison:
    ```sql
    WHERE position = '1'  -- Correct
    WHERE position = 1    -- Incorrect
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Knowledge base not found">
    Ensure you've loaded the knowledge base:
    ```bash
    python cookbook/01_showcase/01_agents/text_to_sql/scripts/load_knowledge.py
    ```
