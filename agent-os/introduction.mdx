**AgentOS turns your agents into a production-ready API you can deploy anywhere.**

You bring the agents and AgentOS turns it into a product:
- 50+ API endpoints with SSE-compatible streaming. Ready for production on day one.
- Sessions, memory, knowledge stored in your database. Your data stays in your system.
- Request-level isolation. No state bleed between users, agents and sessions.
- JWT-based RBAC with hierarchical scopes. Enterprise-ready from day one.
- Tracing built-in, stored in your database. No third-party egress. No vendor lock-in.
- Guardrails, human in the loop, learning machines. The full Agno framework.

Here's an example of an AgentOS serving an Agent with memory, state, and MCP tools:

```python agno_agent.py
from agno.os import AgentOS
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.db.sqlite import SqliteDb
from agno.models.anthropic import Claude

agent = Agent(
    name="Agno Agent",
    model=Claude(id="claude-sonnet-4-5"),
    db=SqliteDb(db_file="agno.db"),
    add_history_to_context=True,
    markdown=True,
)

agent_os = AgentOS(agents=[agent])
app = agent_os.get_app()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    agent_os.serve(app="agno_agent:app", reload=True)
```

AgentOS runs on FastAPI. Add middleware, custom routes, background tasks, or any FastAPI feature without extra configuration.

## Control Plane

AgentOS comes with a built-in [control plane](https://os.agno.com) that connects directly to your runtime from your browser. Monitor sessions. Debug with full traces. Manage users and permissions.

## Private by Design

Most AI tooling stores your data on their servers. You pay retention costs, deal with egress fees, and depend on their security.

AgentOS runs entirely in your infrastructure:
- **Your database**: Sessions, memory, knowledge, traces. All stored where you control it.
- **Zero transmission**: No conversations, logs, or metrics sent to Agno.
- **Nothing stored on our end**: The control plane reads from your database, displays in your browser, stores nothing. When you close the tab, there's no trace of your data anywhere but your own systems.

See [AgentOS Security](/agent-os/security) for more details.

## Architecture

Your AgentOS runs as a container in your cloud. The control plane connects directly from your browser. No proxy servers, no data relay.
