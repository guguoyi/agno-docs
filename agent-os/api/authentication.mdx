AgentOS supports bearer-token authentication to secure your instance. 
When a Security Key is configured, all API routes require an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header for access. Without a key configured, authentication is disabled.

For more details, see the [AgentOS Security](/agent-os/security) guide.
