AgentOS exposes endpoints for running agents and managing sessions, memories, knowledge, and evals. The same API powers the [control plane](/agent-os/control-plane) and can be used to build your AI products.

## Endpoints

| Resource | Operations |
|----------|------------|
| Agents | Run, list, get |
| Teams | Run, list, get |
| Workflows | Run, list, get |
| Sessions | Create, list, get, update, delete |
| Memories | Create, list, get, update, delete |
| Knowledge | Add, search, list, get, delete |
| Evals | Create, list, get, update, delete |
| Metrics | Get, refresh |

See the [API reference](/reference-api/overview) for full documentation.

## Running Agents
```bash
curl http://localhost:7777/agents/my-agent/runs \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "message=Tell me about Agno" \
  -d "stream=true" \
  -d "user_id=john@example.com" \
  -d "session_id=session_123"
```

Teams and workflows follow the same pattern:
- `POST /teams/{team_id}/runs`
- `POST /workflows/{workflow_id}/runs`

## Authentication

If authentication is enabled, include a JWT token:
```bash
curl http://localhost:7777/agents/my-agent/runs \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "message=Your query here"
```

See [Security & Authorization](/agent-os/security) to configure authentication.

## Passing Dependencies

Pass runtime parameters like `dependencies`, `session_state`, or `metadata` as form fields:
```bash
curl http://localhost:7777/agents/story-writer/runs \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "message=Write me a 5 line story" \
  -d 'dependencies={"robot_name": "Anna"}'
```

## Output Schema

Pass a JSON schema to structure the response:
```bash
curl http://localhost:7777/agents/story-writer/runs \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "message=Write a story" \
  -d 'output_schema={"type":"object","properties":{"title":{"type":"string"},"content":{"type":"string"}},"required":["title","content"]}'
```

## Cancelling Runs
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:7777/agents/story-writer/runs/123/cancel
```
