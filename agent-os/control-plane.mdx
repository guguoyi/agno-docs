The control plane is where you chat with agents, view traces, manage knowledge, track sessions, and monitor performance.

It connects directly from your browser to your AgentOS runtime. No data is sent to Agno.

## Chat Interface

Chat with agents, collaborate with teams, and run workflows from one screen.

    style={{ borderRadius: "0.5rem", width: "100%", height: "auto" }}

  </video>
</Frame>

### Agents

Select an agent from the right panel and start a conversation. Each agent maintains its own history, tools, and instructions. Switching agents won't mix contexts.

### Teams

Switch the toggle to Teams. Use the chat stream to watch how the team divides and solves the task.

  </video>
</Frame>

### Workflows

Switch to Workflows. Provide input (plain text or structured, depending on the workflow) and watch execution live as steps stream, produce output, and finish.

  </video>
</Frame>

## Tracing

Traces capture the complete execution flow of agents and teams. Each trace contains spans representing individual operations (LLM calls, tool executions, etc.) with token usage, latency, and error information.

### Tree View

Displays spans in a hierarchical structure showing parent-child relationships between operations. Useful for understanding how teams delegate to agents and how agents invoke tools.

  </video>
</Frame>

### Waterfall View

Visualizes spans on a time axis showing when each operation started, how long it took, and which operations ran in parallel. Helps identify bottlenecks and optimize performance.

## Session Tracking

Sessions group related runs under a single `session_id`. Each session captures messages, tool calls, metrics, and summaries for a single conversation. Sessions are stored in your database and can be queried and managed from the control plane.

  </video>
</Frame>

## Memories

Memories store information that agents learn about users across conversations. Each memory is tied to a user ID and contains content, topics, timestamps, and the input that generated it. You can view, create, edit, or delete memories from the control plane.

## Managing Your AgentOS

Connect and inspect your AgentOS runtimes from a single interface. Switch between local development and production instances and monitor connection health.
