## What You'll Build

A production-ready multi-agent system with three agents:

| Agent | What it does |
|-------|--------------|
| **Pal** | AI-powered second brain. Captures notes, bookmarks, people, meetings, and research. |
| **Knowledge Agent** | Answers questions from a knowledge base (Agentic RAG). |
| **MCP Agent** | Connects to external services via Model Context Protocol. |

You'll run it locally with Docker, then deploy to Railway.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)

## Run Locally

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone the repository">
    ```bash
    git clone \
        https://github.com/agno-agi/agentos-railway-template.git \
        agentos-railway
    cd agentos-railway
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure environment">
    ```bash
    cp example.env .env
    ```
    Add your `OPENAI_API_KEY` to `.env`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start the system">
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d --build
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect to the control plane">
    1. Open [os.agno.com](https://os.agno.com)
    2. Click **Add OS** → **Local**
    3. Enter `http://localhost:8000`
  </Step>
</Steps>

Your multi-agent system is now running:
- **API**: http://localhost:8000
- **Docs**: http://localhost:8000/docs

## Try Pal

Pal is your AI-powered second brain. It captures, organizes, and retrieves your personal knowledge.

**Capture:**
```
Note: decided to use Postgres for the new project - better JSON support
Bookmark https://www.ashpreetbedi.com/articles/lm-technical-design - great intro
```

**Research:**
```
Research event sourcing patterns and save the key findings
```

**Retrieve:**
```
What notes do I have?
What do I know about event sourcing?
```

Pal stores your data in DuckDB and uses the learning system to remember schemas, research findings, and error patterns.

<Note>
Pal is a work in progress. It's a starting point for building your own personal agent.
</Note>

## Deploy to Production

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Railway CLI">
    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash Mac
    brew install railway
    ```
    ```bash Windows
    npm install -g @railway/cli
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Login and deploy">
    ```bash
    railway login
    ./scripts/railway_up.sh
    ```
    The script provisions PostgreSQL, configures environment variables, and deploys your system.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect to the control plane">
    1. Open [os.agno.com](https://os.agno.com)
    2. Click **Add OS** → **Live**
    3. Enter your Railway domain
  </Step>
</Steps>

Your multi-agent system is now live.

## Manage Your Deployment
```bash
railway logs --service agent_os      # View logs
railway open                         # Open dashboard
railway up --service agent_os -d     # Deploy updates
```

## What's Next

You now have a production multi-agent system with:
- **Learning** - Agents that remember and improve over time
- **Persistence** - PostgreSQL for agent state, DuckDB for user data
- **Research** - Web search, company lookup, and people search via Exa
- **Monitoring** - Full visibility via the AgentOS control plane
