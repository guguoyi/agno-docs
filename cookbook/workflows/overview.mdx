description: Sequential caching, parallel execution, and conditional branching patterns.

Workflows that actually orchestrate - not just sequential agent calls. Each example demonstrates real workflow value: phase caching, parallel coordination, or conditional routing.

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIResponses
from agno.workflow import Workflow, Step

researcher = Agent(name="Researcher", model=OpenAIResponses(id="gpt-5.2"))
writer = Agent(name="Writer", model=OpenAIResponses(id="gpt-5.2"))

workflow = Workflow(
    name="Content Pipeline",
    steps=[
        Step(agent=researcher, task="Research the topic"),
        Step(agent=writer, task="Write based on research"),
    ],
)

workflow.run("AI trends in 2025")
```

## Workflow Patterns

| Pattern | Example | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Sequential + Caching** | Blog Post Generator | Phase checkpoints for efficiency |
| **Parallel → Sequential** | Company Description | Gather concurrently, then synthesize |
| **Conditional Branching** | Employee Recruiter | Different paths based on output |
| **Classification Routing** | Notion Manager | Route to different actions by type |
