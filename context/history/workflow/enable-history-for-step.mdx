title: Per-Step History
description: This example demonstrates a workflow with history enabled for a specific step.
---

This example shows how to use the `add_workflow_history` flag to add workflow history to a specific step in the workflow.
In this case we have a workflow with three steps.
- The first step is a research specialist that gathers information on topics.
- The second step is a content creator that writes engaging content.
- The third step is a content publisher that prepares the content for publication.

```python 03_enable_history_for_step.py
"""
This example shows step-level add_workflow_history control.
Only the Content Creator step gets workflow history to avoid repeating previous content.

Workflow: Research → Content Creation (with history) → Publishing
