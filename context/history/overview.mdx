Chat History enables your agents, teams, and workflows to remember and reference previous conversations, creating intelligent and context-aware interactions.

Instead of starting fresh with each interaction, Chat History allows you to:

- **Maintain conversation continuity** - Build on previous exchanges within a session
- **Provide personalized responses** - Reference past interactions to tailor outputs
- **Avoid repetitive questions** - Access previously provided information
- **Enable long-running conversations** - Support multi-turn dialogues with persistent memory

<Note>
All history features require a database configured on your agent, team, or workflow. See [Database](/basics/database/overview) for setup details.
