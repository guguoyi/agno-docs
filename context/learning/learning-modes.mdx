Learning mode gives you full control over when and how a Learning Machine actually learns.

The [learning stores](/context/learning/stores/user-profile.mdx) associated with a Learning Machine can be configured to operate in one of the three learning modes:

* ALWAYS
* AGENTIC
* PROPOSE

## Overview

Following are the three supported learning modes. Each Learning Store can be configured to run in different modes.

| Mode | Behavior | LLM Calls | Best For |
|------|----------|-----------|----------|
| **ALWAYS** | Automatic extraction after each response | Extra call per interaction | Consistent learning |
| **AGENTIC** | Agent uses tools to decide what to save | No extra calls | Selective learning |
| **PROPOSE** | Agent proposes, user confirms | No extra calls | High-stakes knowledge |

## ALWAYS Mode

In ALWAYS mode, the Learning Machine automatically extracts relevant information after each conversation turn. No agent tools are involved - extraction happens in the background.

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.db.postgres import PostgresDb
from agno.learn import LearningMachine, LearningMode, UserProfileConfig
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIResponses

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIResponses(id="gpt-5.2"),
    db=PostgresDb(db_url="postgresql+psycopg://ai:ai@localhost:5532/ai"),
    learning=LearningMachine(
        user_profile=UserProfileConfig(
            mode=LearningMode.ALWAYS,
        ),
    ),
)

# Profile info is extracted automatically - no tool calls visible
agent.print_response(
    "I'm Alice Chen, but please call me Ali.",
    user_id="alice@example.com",
)
```

**How it works:**
1. Agent responds to the user
2. In parallel, an extraction LLM call analyzes the conversation
3. Relevant information is saved to the store
4. No agent awareness or tool calls are required

**Best for:**
- User Profile (capturing names, preferences)
- User Memory (capturing observations)
- Session Context (maintaining summaries)

**Default for Learning Stores:** `user_profile`, `user_memory`, `session_context`

## AGENTIC Mode

In AGENTIC mode, the agent is given tools to explicitly save information. The agent decides when and what to save based on the conversation context.

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.db.postgres import PostgresDb
from agno.learn import LearningMachine, LearningMode, UserProfileConfig
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIResponses

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIResponses(id="gpt-5.2"),
    db=PostgresDb(db_url="postgresql+psycopg://ai:ai@localhost:5532/ai"),
    learning=LearningMachine(
        user_profile=UserProfileConfig(
            mode=LearningMode.AGENTIC,
        ),
    ),
)

# Agent decides to call update_user_profile tool
agent.print_response(
    "Remember that I prefer dark mode interfaces.",
    user_id="alice@example.com",
)
```

**How it works:**
1. Agent receives tools like `update_user_profile`, `save_learning`
2. During response generation, agent decides if/when to call tools
3. Tool calls save information to the store
4. Agent has full control and visibility

**Available tools by store:**

| Store | Tools |
|-------|-------|
| User Profile | `update_user_profile` |
| User Memory | `save_user_memory`, `delete_user_memory` |
| Entity Memory | `search_entities`, `create_entity`, `update_entity`, `add_fact`, `add_event` |
| Learned Knowledge | `search_learnings`, `save_learning` |

**Best for:**
- Learned Knowledge (agent captures insights when relevant)
- Entity Memory (agent builds knowledge graph as needed)

**Default for Learning Stores:** `learned_knowledge`, `entity_memory`

## PROPOSE Mode

In PROPOSE mode, the agent proposes learnings but requires user confirmation before saving. This provides human-in-the-loop quality control.

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.db.postgres import PostgresDb
from agno.knowledge import Knowledge
from agno.knowledge.embedder.openai import OpenAIEmbedder
from agno.learn import LearnedKnowledgeConfig, LearningMachine, LearningMode
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIResponses
from agno.vectordb.pgvector import PgVector, SearchType

db_url = "postgresql+psycopg://ai:ai@localhost:5532/ai"

knowledge = Knowledge(
    vector_db=PgVector(
        db_url=db_url,
        table_name="proposed_learnings",
        search_type=SearchType.hybrid,
        embedder=OpenAIEmbedder(id="text-embedding-3-small"),
    ),
)

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIResponses(id="gpt-5.2"),
    db=PostgresDb(db_url=db_url),
    learning=LearningMachine(
        knowledge=knowledge,
        learned_knowledge=LearnedKnowledgeConfig(
            mode=LearningMode.PROPOSE,
        ),
    ),
)

# Agent proposes a learning, user must confirm
agent.print_response(
    "That's a great insight about API rate limits - we should remember that.",
    user_id="alice@example.com",
)
```

**How it works:**
1. Agent calls `propose_learning` tool
2. Learning is stored with `status="proposed"`
3. User reviews and approves/rejects
4. Only approved learnings are used in future context

**Best for:**
- High-stakes knowledge that needs human review
- Quality control for collective intelligence
- Regulated environments

## Choosing the Right Mode

| Scenario | Recommended Mode |
|----------|------------------|
| Capturing user names and preferences | ALWAYS |
| Building user memory automatically | ALWAYS |
| Tracking session progress | ALWAYS |
| Agent-driven knowledge capture | AGENTIC |
| Building entity knowledge graphs | AGENTIC |
| Compliance-sensitive learning | PROPOSE |
| High-value collective knowledge | PROPOSE |

## Combining Modes

You can use different modes for different stores:

```python
from agno.learn import (
    LearningMachine,
    LearningMode,
    UserProfileConfig,
    UserMemoryConfig,
    LearnedKnowledgeConfig,
)

learning = LearningMachine(
    # Automatic profile extraction
    user_profile=UserProfileConfig(mode=LearningMode.ALWAYS),

    # Automatic memory capture
    user_memory=UserMemoryConfig(mode=LearningMode.ALWAYS),

    # Agent-driven knowledge capture
    learned_knowledge=LearnedKnowledgeConfig(mode=LearningMode.AGENTIC),
)
```

## Performance Considerations

| Mode | Latency Impact | Cost Impact |
|------|----------------|-------------|
| ALWAYS | Adds ~1-2s per response | Extra LLM call per turn |
| AGENTIC | No additional latency | Only when agent calls tools |
| PROPOSE | No additional latency | Only when agent proposes |

AGENTIC mode is recommended for latency-sensitive applications. It allows the agent to decide when learning is worthwhile and when to call tools to save information.

## Default Learning Modes

The "defaults" refer to the built-in learning mode behavior for the different Learning Stores available in Agno.

|Learning Store | Default Mode |Behavior|
|---------------|--------------|--------|
| user_profile | ALWAYS | Automatically extracts name/preferences in the background.|
| user_memory | ALWAYS | Automatically extracts unstructured observations about the user.|
| session_context | ALWAYS | Automatically tracks session goals and summaries.|
| learned_knowledge | AGENTIC | Agent must use tools to save/search for insights.|
| entity_memory | AGENTIC | Agent must use tools to build its "mental rolodex" of entities.|
