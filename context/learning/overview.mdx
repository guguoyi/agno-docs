Most "memory" systems are static databases of facts. A **Learning Machine** is different—it evolves. It combines an Agent with **Learning Stores** to continuous integrate information, improve performance, and share knowledge across users and sessions.

## Learning Stores

A Learning Machine coordinates multiple stores, each optimized for a specific type of knowledge.

| Store | What It Captures | Scope | Use Case |
|-------|------------------|-------|----------|
| [**User Profile**](/context/learning/stores/user-profile) | Structured fields (name, role, preferences) | Per user | Personalization |
| [**User Memory**](/context/learning/stores/user-memory) | Unstructured observations & facts | Per user | Context retention |
| [**Session Context**](/context/learning/stores/session-context) | Goals, plans, and active state | Per session | Long-running tasks |
| [**Entity Memory**](/context/learning/stores/entity-memory) | Facts about business entities | Global | Knowledge graphs |
| [**Learned Knowledge**](/context/learning/stores/learned-knowledge) | Reusable insights & patterns | Global | Team-wide improvement |
