This example demonstrates how to enable sharing of member interactions within a team. When `share_member_interactions` is set to True, team members can see and build upon each other's responses, creating a collaborative workflow.

<Steps>

  <Step title="Create a Python file">
    ```python share_member_interactions.py
    from agno.agent import Agent
    from agno.db.sqlite import SqliteDb
    from agno.models.openai import OpenAIResponses
    from agno.team import Team
    from agno.tools.hackernews import HackerNewsTools

    db = SqliteDb(db_file="tmp/agents.db")

    research_agent = Agent(
        name="Research Agent",
        model=OpenAIResponses(id="gpt-5.2"),
        tools=[HackerNewsTools()],
        instructions="You are a research agent that finds information on HackerNews.",
    )

    report_agent = Agent(
        name="Report Agent",
        model=OpenAIResponses(id="gpt-5.2"),
        instructions="You are a report agent that writes reports from research.",
    )

    team = Team(
        model=OpenAIResponses(id="gpt-5.2"),
        db=db,
        members=[research_agent, report_agent],
        share_member_interactions=True,
        instructions=[
            "You are a team of agents that can research topics and write reports.",
            "First, research the topic using HackerNews.",
            "Then, use your report agent to write a report from the research.",
        ],
        show_members_responses=True,
    )

    team.print_response("What are the latest AI trends?", stream=True)
    ```
