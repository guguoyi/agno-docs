Databases are a foundational part of agent engineering. Add a database to your agent and you get persistent storage for sessions, context, memory, learnings, and evaluation datasets.

- **Chat history.** Include previous messages in context for multi-turn conversations.
- **Session persistence.** Store session information and conversation history across requests.
- **State management.** Store internal agent state across runs. Critical for planning agents.
- **Context control.** Summarize, compress, enrich, and prune context for better responses.
- **Memory and knowledge.** Store user-level facts, searchable knowledge, decision traces, and learned insights.
- **Tracing and evaluation.** Store detailed traces for debugging, monitoring, and building evaluation datasets.
- **Data ownership.** No third-party dependencies. Query your own database. Build evaluation datasets, extract few-shot examples, flag low-quality responses for review.

This is how good software is built. Agents are no different.

## Quick Start
```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.db.sqlite import SqliteDb

agent = Agent(
    db=SqliteDb(db_file="agent.db"),
    add_history_to_context=True,
    num_history_runs=3,
)

# First message
agent.print_response("I'm working on a Python API project", session_id="dev_session")

# Later — agent remembers the context
agent.print_response("What testing framework should I use?", session_id="dev_session")
```

The agent now persists sessions and includes the last 3 runs in every request.

## Works With Teams and Workflows

Storage works identically across Agents, Teams, and Workflows:
```python
from agno.team import Team
from agno.workflow import Workflow
from agno.db.postgres import PostgresDb

db = PostgresDb(db_url="postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/mydb")

team = Team(db=db, ...)
workflow = Workflow(db=db, ...)
```

## Supported Databases

Agno supports 13+ databases for session storage. Use SQLite for development, PostgreSQL for production. [View all supported databases](/database/providers/overview).

## Async Support

For async applications, use the async database classes:

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.db.postgres import AsyncPostgresDb

agent = Agent(
    db=AsyncPostgresDb(db_url="postgresql+psycopg_async://..."),
)
```

## Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="MissingGreenlet exception">
You're using a synchronous engine with an async database class. Use `create_async_engine` from `sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio`.
