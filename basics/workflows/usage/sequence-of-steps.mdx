description: "Use named steps for sequential execution with clear tracking."

This example demonstrates **Workflows** using named Step objects for better tracking
and organization. This pattern provides clear step identification and enhanced logging
while maintaining simple sequential execution.

## Pattern: Sequential Named Steps

**When to use**: Linear processes where you want clear step identification, better logging,
and future platform support. Ideal when you have distinct phases that benefit from naming.
