A Workflow orchestrates agents, teams, and functions as a collection of steps. Steps can run sequentially, in parallel, in loops, or conditionally based on results. Output from each step flows to the next, creating a predictable pipeline for complex tasks.

## Your First Workflow

Here's a simple workflow that takes a topic, researches it, and writes an article:

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.workflow import Workflow
from agno.tools.hackernews import HackerNewsTools

researcher = Agent(
    name="Researcher",
    instructions="Find relevant information about the topic",
    tools=[HackerNewsTools()]
)

writer = Agent(
    name="Writer",
    instructions="Write a clear, engaging article based on the research"
)

content_workflow = Workflow(
    name="Content Creation",
    steps=[researcher, writer]
)

content_workflow.print_response("Write an article about AI trends", stream=True)
```

## When to Use Workflows

Use a workflow when:
- You need predictable, repeatable execution
- Tasks have clear sequential steps with defined inputs and outputs
- You want audit trails and consistent results across runs

Use a [Team](/basics/teams/overview) when you need flexible, collaborative problem-solving where agents coordinate dynamically.

## What Can Be a Step?

| Step Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Agent** | Individual AI executor with specific tools and instructions |
| **Team** | Coordinated group of agents for complex sub-tasks |
| **Function** | Custom Python function for specialized logic |

## Controlling Workflows

Workflows support conditional logic, parallel execution, loops, and conversational interactions. See the guides below for details.
