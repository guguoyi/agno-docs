Agents with storage enabled automatically have access to the run history of the session (also called the "conversation history" or "chat history").

<Note>
For all forms of session history, you need to have a database assigned to the agent. See [Storage](/basics/database/overview) for more details.
</Note>

We can give the Agent access to the chat history in the following ways:

- **Agent-Level History**:
  - You can set `add_history_to_context=True` and `num_history_runs=5` to add the inputs and responses from the last 5 runs automatically to every request sent to the agent.
  - You can be more granular about how many messages to add to include in the list sent to the model, by setting `num_history_messages`.
  - You can set `read_chat_history=True` to provide a `get_chat_history()` tool to your agent allowing it to read any message in the entire chat history.
  - You can set `read_tool_call_history=True` to provide a `get_tool_call_history()` tool to your agent allowing it to read tool calls in reverse chronological order.
  - You can enable `search_session_history` to allow searching through previous sessions.

<Tip>
Working with agent history can be tricky. Experiment with the above settings to find the best fit for your use case.
See the [History Reference](#history-reference) for help on how to use the different history features.

## History Reference

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Simple History">
    Start with **Agent History in Context** for basic conversation continuity:
    ```python
    agent = Agent(
        db=SqliteDb(db_file="tmp/agent.db"),
        add_history_to_context=True,
        num_history_runs=5,
    )
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Long Conversations">
    Add **Chat History Tool** when agents need to search history:
    ```python
    agent = Agent(
        db=SqliteDb(db_file="tmp/agent.db"),
        read_chat_history=True,  # Agent decides when to look up
    )
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Multi-Session Memory">
    Enable **Multi-Session Search** for cross-session continuity:
    ```python
    agent = Agent(
        db=SqliteDb(db_file="tmp/agent.db"),
        search_session_history=True,
        num_history_sessions=2,  # Keep low
    )
    ```
  </Tab>

</Tabs>

<Note>
**Database Requirement**: All history features require a database configured on the agent. See [Storage](/basics/database/overview) for setup.
</Note>

<Tip>
**Performance Tip**: More history = larger context = slower and costlier requests. Start with `num_history_runs=3` and increase only if needed.
</Tip>


### Add history to the agent context

To add the history of the conversation to the context, you can set `add_history_to_context=True`.
This will add the inputs and responses from the last 3 runs (that is the default) to the context of the agent.
You can change the number of runs by setting `num_history_runs=n` where `n` is the number of runs to include.

You can either set `add_history_to_context=True` on the `Agent` or on the `run()` method directly.

Take a look at this example:

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.db.sqlite import SqliteDb

agent = Agent(model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5-mini"), db=SqliteDb(db_file="tmp/agent.db"), add_history_to_context=True)

agent.print_response("Hi, I'm John. Nice to meet you?")

agent.print_response("What is my name?")
```

Learn more in the [Context Engineering](/basics/context/overview) documentation.


## Read the chat history

To read the chat history, you can set `read_chat_history=True`.
This will provide a `get_chat_history()` tool to your agent allowing it to read any message in the entire chat history.


```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.google.gemini import Gemini
from agno.db.sqlite import SqliteDb

agent = Agent(
    model=Gemini(id="gemini-2.0-flash-001"),
    db=SqliteDb(db_file="tmp/agent.db"),
    read_chat_history=True,
    description="You are a helpful assistant that always responds in a polite, upbeat and positive manner.",
)

# Send lots of messages...

agent.print_response("What was my first message?", stream=True)
```

## Search the session history

In some scenarios, you might want to fetch messages from across multiple sessions to provide context or continuity in conversations.

To enable fetching messages from the last N sessions, you need to use the following flags:

- `search_session_history`: Set this to `True` to allow searching through previous sessions.
- `num_history_sessions`: Specify the number of past sessions to include in the search. In the example below, it is set to `2` to include only the last 2 sessions.

It's advisable to keep this number low (2 or 3), as a larger number might fill up the context length of the model, potentially leading to performance issues.

Here's an example of searching through the last 2 sessions:

```python
# Remove the tmp db file before running the script
import os

from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.db.sqlite import SqliteDb

os.remove("tmp/data.db")

db = SqliteDb(db_file="tmp/data.db")

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5-mini"),
    user_id="user_1",
    db=db,
    search_session_history=True,  # allow searching previous sessions
    num_history_sessions=2,  # only include the last 2 sessions in the search to avoid context length issues
)

session_1_id = "session_1_id"
session_2_id = "session_2_id"
session_3_id = "session_3_id"
session_4_id = "session_4_id"
session_5_id = "session_5_id"

agent.print_response("What is the capital of South Africa?", session_id=session_1_id)
agent.print_response("What is the capital of China?", session_id=session_2_id)
agent.print_response("What is the capital of France?", session_id=session_3_id)
agent.print_response("What is the capital of Japan?", session_id=session_4_id)
agent.print_response(
    "What did I discuss in my previous conversations?", session_id=session_5_id
)  # It should only include the last 2 sessions
```
