sidebarTitle: Overview
description: Reasoning models are a class of large language models pre-trained to think before they answer. They produce a long internal chain of thought before responding.

Examples of reasoning models include:
- OpenAI o1-pro and gpt-5-mini
- Claude 3.7 sonnet in extended-thinking mode
- Gemini 2.0 flash thinking
- DeepSeek-R1

Reasoning models deeply consider and think through a plan before taking action. Its all about what the model does **before it starts generating a response**. Reasoning models excel at single-shot use-cases. They're perfect for solving hard problems (coding, math, physics) that don't require multiple turns, or calling tools sequentially.

## Examples

### gpt-5-mini

```python gpt_5_mini.py
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat

# Setup your Agent using a reasoning model
agent = Agent(model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5-mini"))

# Run the Agent
agent.print_response(
    "Solve the trolley problem. Evaluate multiple ethical frameworks. Include an ASCII diagram of your solution.",
    stream=True,
    show_full_reasoning=True,
)
```

### gpt-5-mini with tools

```python gpt_5_mini_with_tools.py
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools

# Setup your Agent using a reasoning model
agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5-mini"),
    tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()],
    markdown=True,
)

# Run the Agent
agent.print_response("What is the best basketball team in the NBA this year?", stream=True)
```

### gpt-5-mini with reasoning effort

```python gpt_5_mini_with_reasoning_effort.py
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools

# Setup your Agent using a reasoning model with high reasoning effort
agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5-mini", reasoning_effort="high"),
    tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()],
    markdown=True,
)

# Run the Agent
agent.print_response("What is the best basketball team in the NBA this year?", stream=True)
```

### DeepSeek-R1 using Groq

```python deepseek_r1_using_groq.py
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.groq import Groq

# Setup your Agent using a reasoning model
agent = Agent(
    model=Groq(
        id="deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", temperature=0.6, max_tokens=1024, top_p=0.95
    ),
    markdown=True,
)

# Run the Agent
agent.print_response("9.11 and 9.9 -- which is bigger?", stream=True)
```

## Reasoning Model + Response Model

When you run the DeepSeek-R1 Agent above, you'll notice that the response is not that great. This is because DeepSeek-R1 is great at solving problems but not that great at responding in a natural way (like claude sonnet or gpt-4.5).

To solve this problem, Agno supports using separate models for reasoning and response generation. This approach leverages a reasoning model for problem-solving while using a different model optimized for natural language responses, combining the strengths of both.

### DeepSeek-R1 + Claude Sonnet

```python deepseek_plus_claude.py
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.anthropic import Claude
from agno.models.groq import Groq

# Setup your Agent using an extra reasoning model
deepseek_plus_claude = Agent(
    model=Claude(id="claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219"),
    reasoning_model=Groq(
        id="deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", temperature=0.6, max_tokens=1024, top_p=0.95
    ),
)

# Run the Agent
deepseek_plus_claude.print_response("9.11 and 9.9 -- which is bigger?", stream=True)
```
