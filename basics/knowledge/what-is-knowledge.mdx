---

**Knowledge** allows agents and teams to reference external information, enabling accurate and relevant responses beyond the model’s training data.

Common use cases include company documentation (HR policies, product specs), database schemas for text-to-SQL, FAQ databases, and any domain-specific information your agents need.
