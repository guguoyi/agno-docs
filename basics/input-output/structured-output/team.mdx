sidebarTitle: Team
description: Get validated Pydantic objects from team responses.
---

Set `output_schema` on a team to constrain its final response to a Pydantic model. The team leader synthesizes member outputs into a validated object.

## Basic Usage
```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIResponses
from agno.team import Team
from agno.tools.hackernews import HackerNewsTools
from agno.tools.yfinance import YFinanceTools

class ResearchReport(BaseModel):
    title: str
    summary: str = Field(description="Executive summary of findings")
    key_insights: list[str] = Field(description="Top 3-5 insights")
    recommendation: str

news_agent = Agent(
    name="News Researcher",
    role="Research tech news and trends",
    tools=[HackerNewsTools()]
)

finance_agent = Agent(
    name="Finance Analyst",
    role="Analyze financial data and stocks",
    tools=[YFinanceTools()]
)

team = Team(
    name="Research Team",
    model=OpenAIResponses(id="gpt-5.2"),
    members=[news_agent, finance_agent],
    output_schema=ResearchReport,
)

response = team.run("Research NVIDIA - analyze stock performance and recent news")

# response.content is a validated ResearchReport object
report: ResearchReport = response.content
print(report.title)
print(report.summary)
print(report.recommendation)
```

## How It Works

When a team has `output_schema` set:

1. The team leader delegates tasks to members
2. Members execute and return their results
3. The leader synthesizes all member outputs
4. The final response is structured according to your schema

Only the team's final output is structured. Individual member responses remain unstructured unless those members have their own `output_schema`.

## Per-Run Schema

Override or set the schema at run time:
```python
team = Team(
    model=OpenAIResponses(id="gpt-5.2"),
    members=[news_agent, finance_agent],
)

# Different schemas for different requests
report = team.run("Analyze AI market", output_schema=MarketReport)
comparison = team.run("Compare NVDA vs AMD", output_schema=StockComparison)
```

## Member and Team Schemas

You can set `output_schema` on both individual members and the team:
```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIResponses
from agno.team import Team
from agno.tools.hackernews import HackerNewsTools
from agno.tools.yfinance import YFinanceTools

# Member schemas
class NewsInsights(BaseModel):
    headlines: list[str]
    sentiment: str = Field(description="positive, negative, or neutral")

class FinanceInsights(BaseModel):
    price: float
    change_percent: float
    recommendation: str

# Team schema
class CombinedReport(BaseModel):
    summary: str
    market_sentiment: str
    stock_outlook: str
    final_recommendation: str

news_agent = Agent(
    name="News Analyst",
    role="Research news",
    tools=[HackerNewsTools()],
    output_schema=NewsInsights,
)

finance_agent = Agent(
    name="Finance Analyst",
    role="Analyze stocks",
    tools=[YFinanceTools()],
    output_schema=FinanceInsights,
)

team = Team(
    model=OpenAIResponses(id="gpt-5.2"),
    members=[news_agent, finance_agent],
    output_schema=CombinedReport,
)

response = team.run("Full analysis of NVDA")
report: CombinedReport = response.content
```

Member schemas ensure consistent intermediate outputs. The team schema controls the final synthesized response.

## Schema Design for Teams

### Aggregate Multiple Perspectives

Design schemas that capture synthesized insights:
```python
class CompetitiveAnalysis(BaseModel):
    company: str
    market_position: str = Field(description="Leader, challenger, or follower")
    technical_strengths: list[str] = Field(description="From technical research")
    financial_strengths: list[str] = Field(description="From financial analysis")
    combined_outlook: str
```

### Include Confidence and Reasoning
```python
class InvestmentRecommendation(BaseModel):
    ticker: str
    action: str = Field(description="buy, hold, or sell")
    price_target: float | None = None
    reasoning: str = Field(description="Synthesized reasoning from all analysts")
    risk_factors: list[str]
    confidence: float = Field(ge=0, le=1)
```

### Structured Comparisons
```python
class CompanyComparison(BaseModel):
    companies: list[str]
    winner: str
    comparison_criteria: list[str]
    scores: dict[str, dict[str, int]]  # company -> criterion -> score
    summary: str
```

## JSON Mode Fallback

For models without native structured output:
```python
team = Team(
    model=SomeModel(),
    members=[...],
    output_schema=MySchema,
    use_json_mode=True,
)
```

<Note>
JSON mode instructs the model to respond in JSON but doesn't guarantee schema compliance. Prefer models with native structured output support.
