Providing inputs to an agentic system and receiving outputs
from it is a fundamental aspect of building learning machines.

In production grade systems you want to validate what you send to the agent and what comes back from it.

## Quick Start

The following code creates a simple agent that validates both input and output using Pydantic models.

Create a type-safe agent in seconds:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIResponses

# 1. Define Input & Output
class InputData(BaseModel):
    items: list[str]

class OutputValidation(BaseModel):
    is_valid: bool
    reason: str

# 2. Create Agent
agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIResponses(id="gpt-5.2"),
    # Set the Output Schema
    output_schema=OutputValidation
)

# 3. Run with Type Safety
response = agent.run(
    "Check these items",
    # Pass the Input Model
    input=InputData(items=["apple", "banana"])
)

# 4. Get Validated Data
result: OutputValidation = response.content
print(result.is_valid)
```
## Structured I/O 

You can control agent input and outputs by working with simple string or structured data as input and output.

**Unstructured I/O** is like shouting instructions and getting a rough answer back that must be further
worked upon. It works, but it's messy.

**Structured I/O** is like using a strict form instead of a casual conversation.
Instead of hoping for a good answer (Unstructured), you force the agent to fill out specific fields
 (Structured)—guaranteeing you get exactly the data you need for reliable systems.

Structured and type-safe inputs and outputs are key to building production grade, reliable and maintainable
learning machines.

## Typesafe Patterns

When you combine both `input_schema` and `output_schema`, you create a **typesafe** component with end-to-end type safety—a fully validated data pipeline from input to output. This ensures that your agents and teams act like reliable, strongly-typed software functions, preventing runtime errors and ensuring data consistency across your entire application.

## Best Practice 
If you are building a [Learning Machine](../context/learning/overview), use Structured Inputs to feed it context from the database (like User History) and Structured Outputs to extract new learnings to save back to the database.

* **Input:** UserContextModel (Fetched from DB)
* **Output:** NewLearningExtraction (Saved to DB)
