Storage lets your agent remember conversations. With the same `session_id`, it picks up where you left off, even after restarting.

<Steps>

  <Step title="Create a Python file">
    ```python agent_with_storage.py
    from agno.agent import Agent
    from agno.db.sqlite import SqliteDb
    from agno.models.openai import OpenAIResponses
    from agno.tools.yfinance import YFinanceTools

    db = SqliteDb(db_file="tmp/agents.db")

    agent = Agent(
        model=OpenAIResponses(id="gpt-5.2"),
        tools=[YFinanceTools()],
        db=db,
        add_history_to_context=True,
        num_history_runs=5,
        markdown=True,
    )

    session_id = "finance-session"

    # Turn 1: Analyze a stock
    agent.print_response(
        "Give me a quick analysis of NVIDIA",
        session_id=session_id,
        stream=True,
    )

    # Turn 2: The agent remembers NVDA from turn 1
    agent.print_response(
        "Compare that to AMD",
        session_id=session_id,
        stream=True,
    )

    # Turn 3: Ask based on full conversation
    agent.print_response(
        "Which looks like the better investment?",
        session_id=session_id,
        stream=True,
    )
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install dependencies">
    ```bash
    uv pip install -U agno openai yfinance sqlalchemy
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Export your OpenAI API key">

    <CodeGroup>

    ```bash Mac/Linux
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
    ```

    ```bash Windows
    $Env:OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run Agent">
    ```bash
    python agent_with_storage.py
    ```
  </Step>

</Steps>

## Key Concepts

- **Session:** A conversation thread identified by `session_id`
- **Same `session_id` = continuous conversation**, even across script runs
- **`add_history_to_context=True`:** Includes previous messages in context
- **`num_history_runs=5`:** Number of previous runs to include
