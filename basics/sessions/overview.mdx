When we call `Agent.run()`, it creates a stateless, singular Agent run.

But what if we want to continue this conversation i.e. have a multi-turn conversation? That's where "Sessions" come in. A session is collection of consecutive runs.

In practice, a session is a multi-turn conversation between a user and an Agent/Team/Workflow. Using a `session_id`, we can connect the conversation history and state across multiple runs.

Here are the core concepts:

- **Session:** A session is collection of consecutive runs like a multi-turn conversation between a user and an Agent/Team/Workflow. Sessions are identified by a `session_id` and house all runs, metrics, state and other data that belong to the session.
- **Run:** Every interaction (i.e. chat or turn) with an Agent/Team/Workflow is called a **run**. Runs are identified by a `run_id` and `Agent.run()`, `Team.run()` or `Workflow.run()` creates a new `run_id` when called.

See [Session Storage](/basics/storage/overview) for more details on how sessions are stored.


## Single session

Here we have an example where a single run is created with an Agent. 
A `run_id` is automatically generated, as well as a `session_id` (because we didn't provide one to continue the conversation).

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat

agent = Agent(model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5-mini"))

# Run agent and return the response as a variable
response = agent.run("Tell me a 5 second short story about a robot")
print(response.content)
print(response.run_id)
print(response.session_id)
```

## Multi-user, multi-turn Sessions

Each user that is interacting with an Agent/Team/Workflow gets a unique set of sessions and you can have multiple users interacting with the same Agent/Team/Workflow at the same time.

Set a `user_id` to connect a user to their sessions.

In the example below, we set a `session_id` to demo how to have multi-turn conversations with multiple users at the same time.

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.db.sqlite import SqliteDb

db = SqliteDb(db_file="tmp/data.db")

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5-mini"),
    db=db,
    add_history_to_context=True,
    num_history_runs=3,
)

user_1_id = "user_101"
user_2_id = "user_102"

user_1_session_id = "session_101"
user_2_session_id = "session_102"

# Start the session with user 1
agent.print_response(
    "Tell me a 5 second short story about a robot.",
    user_id=user_1_id,
    session_id=user_1_session_id,
)
# Continue the session with user 1
agent.print_response("Now tell me a joke.", user_id=user_1_id, session_id=user_1_session_id)

# Start the session with user 2
agent.print_response("Tell me about quantum physics.", user_id=user_2_id, session_id=user_2_session_id)

# Continue the session with user 2
agent.print_response("What is the speed of light?", user_id=user_2_id, session_id=user_2_session_id)

# Ask the agent to give a summary of the conversation, this will use the history from the previous messages (but only for user 1)
agent.print_response(
    "Give me a summary of our conversation.",
    user_id=user_1_id,
    session_id=user_1_session_id,
)
```
<Note>
  For session history and management, you need to have a database assigned to
  the agent. See [Storage](/basics/storage/overview) for more details.
</Note>

<Check>
You might have noticed that we set `add_history_to_context=True` and `num_history_runs=3` on the Agent. 
This is to add the history of the conversation to the context, so the Agent can use it to generate a response.

Learn more in the [Chat History](/basics/chat_history/overview) documentation.

## Session Summaries

An Agent or Team can store a condensed representations of the session, useful when chat histories gets too long. This is called a "Session Summary" in Agno.

See the details:
- [Session Summaries with Agents](/basics/sessions/agent#session-summaries)
- [Session Summaries with Teams](/basics/sessions/team#session-summaries)


## Session table schema

If you have a `db` configured for your team, the sessions will be stored in the sessions table in your database.

The schema for the sessions table is as follows:

| Field           | Type   | Description                                      |
| --------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `session_id`    | `str`  | The unique identifier for the session.           |
| `session_type`  | `str`  | The type of the session.                         |
| `agent_id`      | `str`  | The agent ID of the session.                     |
| `team_id`       | `str`  | The team ID of the session.                      |
| `workflow_id`   | `str`  | The workflow ID of the session.                  |
| `user_id`       | `str`  | The user ID of the session.                      |
| `session_data`  | `dict` | The data of the session.                         |
| `agent_data`    | `dict` | The data of the agent.                           |
| `team_data`     | `dict` | The data of the team.                            |
| `workflow_data` | `dict` | The data of the workflow.                        |
| `metadata`      | `dict` | The metadata of the session.                     |
| `runs`          | `list` | The runs of the session.                         |
| `summary`       | `dict` | The summary of the session.                      |
| `created_at`    | `int`  | The timestamp when the session was created.      |
| `updated_at`    | `int`  | The timestamp when the session was last updated. |

This data is best displayed on the [sessions page of the AgentOS UI](https://os.agno.com/sessions).
