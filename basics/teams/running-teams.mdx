---

Run your team with `Team.run()` (sync) or `Team.arun()` (async).

## Basic Execution

```python
from agno.team import Team
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIResponses
from agno.tools.hackernews import HackerNewsTools
from agno.tools.yfinance import YFinanceTools
from agno.utils.pprint import pprint_run_response

news_agent = Agent(name="News Agent", role="Get tech news", tools=[HackerNewsTools()])
finance_agent = Agent(name="Finance Agent", role="Get stock data", tools=[YFinanceTools()])

team = Team(
    name="Research Team",
    members=[news_agent, finance_agent],
    model=OpenAIResponses(id="gpt-4o")
)

# Run and get response
response = team.run("What are the trending AI stories?")
print(response.content)

# Run with streaming
stream = team.run("What are the trending AI stories?", stream=True)
for chunk in stream:
    print(chunk.content, end="", flush=True)
```

## Execution Flow

When you call `run()`:

1. **Pre-hooks execute** (if configured)
2. **Reasoning runs** (if enabled) to plan the task
3. **Context is built** with system message, history, memories, and session state
4. **Model decides** whether to respond directly, use tools, or delegate to members
5. **Members execute** their tasks (concurrently in async mode)
6. **Leader synthesizes** member results into a final response
7. **Post-hooks execute** (if configured)
8. **Session and metrics are stored** (if database configured)

## Streaming

Enable streaming with `stream=True`. This returns an iterator of events instead of a single response.

```python
stream = team.run("What are the top AI stories?", stream=True)
for chunk in stream:
    print(chunk.content, end="", flush=True)
```

### Stream All Events

By default, only content is streamed. Set `stream_events=True` to get tool calls, reasoning steps, and other internal events:

```python
stream = team.run(
    "What are the trending AI stories?",
    stream=True,
    stream_events=True
)

for event in stream:
    if event.event == TeamRunEvent.run_content:
        print(event.content, end="", flush=True)
    elif event.event == TeamRunEvent.tool_call_started:
        print(f"Tool call started")
    elif event.event == TeamRunEvent.tool_call_completed:
        print(f"Tool call completed")
```

### Stream Member Events

When using `arun()` with multiple members, they execute concurrently. Member events arrive as they happen, not in order.

Disable member event streaming with `stream_member_events=False`:

```python
team = Team(
    name="Research Team",
    members=[news_agent, finance_agent],
    model=OpenAIResponses(id="gpt-4o"),
    stream_member_events=False
)
```

## Run Output

`Team.run()` returns a `TeamRunOutput` object containing:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `content` | The final response text |
| `messages` | All messages sent to the model |
| `metrics` | Token usage, execution time, etc. |
| `member_responses` | Responses from delegated members |

See [TeamRunOutput reference](/reference/teams/team-response) for the full schema.

## Async Execution

Use `arun()` for async execution. Members run concurrently when the leader delegates to multiple members at once.

```python
import asyncio

async def main():
    response = await team.arun("Research AI trends and stock performance")
    print(response.content)

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Specifying User and Session

Associate runs with a user and session for history tracking:

```python
team.run(
    "Get my monthly report",
    user_id="john@example.com",
    session_id="session_123"
)
```

See [Sessions](/basics/sessions/overview) for details.

## Passing Files

Pass images, audio, video, or files to the team:

```python
from agno.media import Image

team.run(
    "Analyze this image",
    images=[Image(url="https://example.com/image.jpg")]
)
```

See [Multimodal](/features/multimodal/overview) for details.

## Structured Output

Pass an output schema to get structured responses:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class Report(BaseModel):
    overview: str
    findings: list[str]

response = team.run("Analyze the market", output_schema=Report)
```

See [Input & Output](/basics/input-output/overview) for details.

## Cancelling Runs

Cancel a running team with `Team.cancel_run()`. See [Run Cancellation](/execution-control/run-cancellation/overview).

## Print Response

For development, use `print_response()` to display formatted output:

```python
team.print_response("What are the top AI stories?", stream=True)

# Show member responses too
team.print_response("What are the top AI stories?", show_members_responses=True)
```
