description: Define team members, roles, and structure for multi-agent coordination.

Start simple: a model, team members, and instructions. Add functionality as needed.

## Minimal Example

```python research_team.py
from agno.team import Team
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIResponses
from agno.tools.hackernews import HackerNewsTools
from agno.tools.yfinance import YFinanceTools

news_agent = Agent(
    name="News Agent",
    role="Get trending tech news from HackerNews",
    tools=[HackerNewsTools()]
)

finance_agent = Agent(
    name="Finance Agent",
    role="Get stock prices and financial data",
    tools=[YFinanceTools()]
)

team = Team(
    name="Research Team",
    members=[news_agent, finance_agent],
    model=OpenAIResponses(id="gpt-4o"),
    instructions="Delegate to the appropriate agent based on the request."
)

team.print_response("What are the trending AI stories and how is NVDA stock doing?", stream=True)
```

## Team Members

Each member should have a `name` and `role`. The team leader uses these to decide who handles what.

```python
news_agent = Agent(
    name="News Agent",                              # Identifies the agent
    role="Get trending tech news from HackerNews",  # Tells the leader what this agent does
    tools=[HackerNewsTools()]
)
```

For better tracing, also set an `id`:

```python
news_agent = Agent(
    id="news-agent",
    name="News Agent",
    role="Get trending tech news from HackerNews",
    tools=[HackerNewsTools()]
)
```

## Nested Teams

Teams can contain other teams. The top-level leader delegates to sub-team leaders, who delegate to their members.

```python
from agno.team import Team
from agno.agent import Agent

team = Team(
    name="Language Team",
    members=[
        Agent(name="English Agent", role="Answer in English"),
        Agent(name="Chinese Agent", role="Answer in Chinese"),
        Team(
            name="Germanic Team",
            role="Handle German and Dutch questions",
            members=[
                Agent(name="German Agent", role="Answer in German"),
                Agent(name="Dutch Agent", role="Answer in Dutch"),
            ],
        ),
    ],
)
```

## Model Inheritance

Team members inherit the `model` from their parent team if not explicitly set.

```python
from agno.team import Team
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIResponses
from agno.models.anthropic import Claude

# This agent uses its own model (Claude)
agent_with_model = Agent(
    name="Claude Agent",
    model=Claude(id="claude-sonnet-4-5"),
    role="Research with Claude"
)

# This agent inherits gpt-4o from the team
agent_without_model = Agent(
    name="Inherited Agent",
    role="Research with inherited model"
)

team = Team(
    name="Research Team",
    model=OpenAIResponses(id="gpt-4o"),  # Default for team and members without a model
    members=[agent_with_model, agent_without_model]
)
```

## Team Features

Teams support the same features as agents:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Instructions | Guide the team leader on how to coordinate |
| Database | Persist session history and state |
| Reasoning | Enable the leader to plan before delegating |
| Knowledge | Give the leader access to a knowledge base |
| Memory | Store and recall information across sessions |
| Tools | Give the leader tools to use directly |

See the guides below to add these features.
