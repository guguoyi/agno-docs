Teams add coordination complexity. When something goes wrong, you need to trace execution across the leader and all members.

## Debug Mode

Enable debug mode to see the messages sent to the model, tool calls, delegation patterns, and metrics.

```python
from agno.team import Team
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIResponses

news_agent = Agent(name="News Agent", role="Get the latest news")
weather_agent = Agent(name="Weather Agent", role="Get weather forecasts")

team = Team(
    name="Research Team",
    members=[news_agent, weather_agent],
    model=OpenAIResponses(id="gpt-4o"),
    debug_mode=True
)

team.print_response("What is the weather in Tokyo?", show_members_responses=True)
```

Three ways to enable debug mode:

| Method | Scope |
|--------|-------|
| `debug_mode=True` on Team | All runs for this team |
| `debug_mode=True` on `run()` | Single run only |
| `AGNO_DEBUG=True` env var | All teams globally |

Set `debug_level=2` for more detailed logs:

```python
team = Team(
    name="Research Team",
    members=[news_agent, weather_agent],
    model=OpenAIResponses(id="gpt-4o"),
    debug_mode=True,
    debug_level=2
)
```

## What to Look For

When debugging, check:

| Issue | What to inspect |
|-------|-----------------|
| Wrong member selected | Leader's reasoning, member roles |
| Member not responding | Member's tool calls, errors |
| Slow execution | Token counts, sequential vs parallel execution |
| Unexpected output | Leader's synthesis step, member responses |
| High token usage | Coordination overhead, context size |

## Common Failure Modes

### Leader Delegates to Wrong Member

The leader picks members based on their `role`. If delegation is wrong:

1. Check that roles clearly describe what each member does
2. Make roles distinct (avoid overlap)
3. Add instructions to the team leader

```python
# Bad: Roles are vague
agent1 = Agent(name="Agent 1", role="Research things")
agent2 = Agent(name="Agent 2", role="Look stuff up")

# Good: Roles are specific and distinct
news_agent = Agent(name="News Agent", role="Get tech news from HackerNews")
finance_agent = Agent(name="Finance Agent", role="Get stock prices from Yahoo Finance")
```

### Member Fails Silently

If a member fails, the leader may synthesize a response without that member's output. Enable `show_members_responses=True` to see what each member returned:

```python
team.print_response("Research AI trends", show_members_responses=True)
```

### Infinite Delegation Loop

The leader keeps delegating without producing a final response. This usually means:

1. Instructions are unclear about when to stop
2. Members are returning incomplete results

Add explicit stopping criteria to instructions:

```python
team = Team(
    name="Research Team",
    members=[...],
    instructions=[
        "Delegate to members to gather information.",
        "Once you have enough information, synthesize and respond directly.",
        "Do not delegate more than 3 times per request."
    ]
)
```

### High Token Usage

Multi-agent coordination burns tokens. A 4-member team can easily use 10x the tokens of a single agent.

Check token usage in debug output or metrics:

```python
response = team.run("Research AI trends")
print(f"Total tokens: {response.metrics.total_tokens}")
```

To reduce tokens:
- Use fewer members
- Keep member responses concise
- Use `respond_directly=True` to skip synthesis

## Interactive CLI

Test multi-turn conversations with the built-in CLI:

```python
from agno.team import Team
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.db.sqlite import SqliteDb
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIResponses

news_agent = Agent(name="News Agent", role="Get the latest news")
weather_agent = Agent(name="Weather Agent", role="Get weather forecasts")

team = Team(
    name="Research Team",
    members=[news_agent, weather_agent],
    model=OpenAIResponses(id="gpt-4o"),
    db=SqliteDb(db_file="tmp/data.db"),
    add_history_to_context=True,
    num_history_runs=3
)

team.cli_app(stream=True)
```

Use `await team.acli_app()` for async.

## Tracing with AgentOS

For production debugging, connect your team to [AgentOS](/agent-os/overview) to get:

- Visual trace of all delegation and tool calls
- Token usage breakdown by member
- Session history and replay
- Error tracking
