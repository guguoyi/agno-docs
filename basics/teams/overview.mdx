A Team is a collection of agents (or sub-teams) that work together. The team leader delegates tasks to members based on their roles.

```python
from agno.team import Team
from agno.agent import Agent

team = Team(members=[
    Agent(name="English Agent", role="You answer questions in English"),
    Agent(name="Chinese Agent", role="You answer questions in Chinese"),
    Team(
        name="Germanic Team",
        role="You coordinate the team members to answer questions in German and Dutch",
        members=[
            Agent(name="German Agent", role="You answer questions in German"),
            Agent(name="Dutch Agent", role="You answer questions in Dutch"),
        ],
    ),
])
```

## Why Teams?

Single agents hit limits fast. Context windows fill up, decision-making gets muddy, and debugging becomes impossible when one agent handles everything.

Teams solve this by distributing work across specialized agents:

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Specialization | Each agent masters one domain instead of being mediocre at everything |
| Parallel processing | Multiple agents work simultaneously on independent subtasks |
| Maintainability | When something breaks, you know exactly which agent to fix |
| Scalability | Add new capabilities by adding agents, not rewriting everything |

The tradeoff: coordination overhead. Agents need to communicate and share state. Get this wrong and you've built a more expensive failure mode.

## When to Use Teams

Use a team when:
- A task requires multiple specialized agents with different tools or expertise
- A single agent's context window gets exceeded due to task complexity
- You want to keep each agent focused on a narrow scope

Use a single agent when:
- The task is simple enough for one domain of expertise
- Minimizing token costs matters
- You're not sure yet (start simple, add agents when you hit limits)

## Team Patterns

Teams support three main coordination patterns:

| Pattern | Configuration | Use case |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| **Supervisor** (default) | Default settings | Task decomposition, quality control, synthesis |
| **Router** | `respond_directly=True`, `determine_input_for_members=False` | Route requests to specialists without synthesis |
| **Broadcast** | `delegate_to_all_members=True` | Parallel research, gather multiple perspectives |

See [Delegation](/basics/teams/delegation) for details on each pattern.
