**State** is any kind of data that needs to be maintained throughout runs in a session.

A simple yet common use case for Agents, Teams and Workflows is to manage lists, items and other "information" for a user. For example, a shopping list, a todo list, a wishlist, etc.
This can be easily managed using the `session_state`. The Agent, Team or Workflow can access or update the `session_state` in tool calls and exposes them to the Model via the system context.

The session state is then persisted in the configured database and made available across runs within that session.
