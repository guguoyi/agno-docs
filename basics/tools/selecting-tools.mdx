You can specify which tools to include or exclude from a `Toolkit` by using the `include_tools` and `exclude_tools` parameters. This can be very useful to limit the number of tools that are available to an Agent.

For example, here's how to include only the `get_latest_emails` tool in the `GmailTools` toolkit:

```python
agent = Agent(
    tools=[GmailTools(include_tools=["get_latest_emails"])],
)
```

Similarly, here's how to exclude the `create_draft_email` tool from the `GmailTools` toolkit:

```python
agent = Agent(
    tools=[GmailTools(exclude_tools=["create_draft_email"])],
)
```

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the `include_tools` and `exclude_tools` parameters to limit the number of tools that are available to an Agent:

```python include_exclude_tools.py
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIResponses
from agno.tools.calculator import CalculatorTools
from agno.tools.yfinance import YFinanceTools

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIResponses(id="gpt-5.2"),
    tools=[
        CalculatorTools(
            exclude_tools=["exponentiate", "factorial", "is_prime", "square_root"],
        ),
        YFinanceTools(include_tools=["get_stock_price"]),
    ],
    markdown=True,
)

agent.print_response(
    "Get the stock price of AAPL and NVDA, then calculate the sum of both prices.",
)
```
