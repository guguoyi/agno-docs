---

This example demonstrates how to cancel a running agent execution by starting an agent run in a separate thread and cancelling it from another thread. It shows proper handling of cancelled responses and thread management.

## Example

```python agent_cancel_run.py
"""
Example demonstrating how to cancel a running agent execution.

This example shows how to:
1. Start an agent run in a separate thread
2. Cancel the run from another thread
3. Handle the cancelled response

## API Endpoint

Agent runs can be cancelled via the AgentOS API:

```bash
POST /agents/{agent_id}/runs/{run_id}/cancel
```

**Example:**
```bash
curl --location 'http://localhost:7777/agents/story-writer-agent/runs/123/cancel' \
  --request POST
```
