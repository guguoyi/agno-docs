title: Cancelling a Run
sidebarTitle: Overview
description: Cancel running agent, team, or workflow executions.
---

Run cancellation provides the ability to stop running agent, team, or workflow executions. This feature is useful for managing long-running operations, implementing timeouts, or allowing users to interrupt processes.

## How It Works

The `cancel_run()` function marks a run for cancellation. Execution stops gracefully once the current step completes, ensuring that operations finish cleanly without leaving resources in an inconsistent state.

**Cancellation Behavior:**
- **Non-Streaming Runs**: The `RunOutput` object is returned with status set to `RunStatus.cancelled`.
- **Streaming Runs**: A `RunCancelledEvent` is emitted when cancellation occurs.
