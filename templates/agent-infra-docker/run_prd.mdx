The Agent Infra Docker template delivers a production-ready Docker Compose configuration and Dockerfile designed to deploy AgentOS reliably across diverse infrastructure environments. Packaged as a standard containerized system, it provides full flexibility to run anywhere containers are supported, including AWS ECS, Google Cloud Compute Engine, Azure virtual machines, and on-premise servers. This template gives you the freedom to deploy AgentOS on any infrastructure of your choice.

For a purpose-built, AWS optimized deployment, refer to the Agent Infra AWS template, which demonstrates how to operationalize AgentOS in production on AWS using ECS.
