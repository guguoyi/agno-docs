A skill is a directory containing a `SKILL.md` file with optional `scripts/` and `references/` subdirectories.

## Directory Structure

```
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md           # Required: Instructions with YAML frontmatter
├── scripts/           # Optional: Executable scripts
│   └── helper.py
└── references/        # Optional: Reference documentation
    └── guide.md
```

## The SKILL.md File

The `SKILL.md` file is the heart of a skill. It contains YAML frontmatter with metadata, followed by markdown instructions.

### Required Fields

```yaml
---
name: my-skill
description: Short description of what this skill does
---
```

- **name**: Must be lowercase, alphanumeric with hyphens only (max 64 characters)
- **description**: Brief summary shown in the agent's system prompt (max 1024 characters)

### Optional Fields

```yaml
---
name: code-review
description: Code review assistance with style checking and best practices
license: Apache-2.0
metadata:
  version: "1.0.0"
  author: your-name
  tags: ["python", "code-quality"]
---
```

### Full Example

```markdown
---
name: code-review

metadata:
  version: "1.0.0"

# Code Review Skill

Use this skill when reviewing code for quality, style, and best practices.

## When to Use

- User asks for code review or feedback
- User wants to improve code quality
- User needs help with refactoring

## Process

1. **Analyze Structure**: Review overall code organization
2. **Check Style**: Look for style guide violations
3. **Identify Issues**: Find bugs, security issues, performance problems
4. **Suggest Improvements**: Provide actionable recommendations

## Best Practices

- Focus on the most impactful issues first
- Explain the "why" behind suggestions
- Provide code examples for fixes
```

## Adding Scripts

Scripts are executable files the agent can run. They must have a shebang line.

### Python Script Example

Create `scripts/check_style.py`:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Check code style and return results."""

import sys

def check_style(code: str) -> dict:
    issues = []
    lines = code.split('\n')

    for i, line in enumerate(lines, 1):
        if len(line) > 100:
            issues.append(f"Line {i}: exceeds 100 characters")
        if line.endswith(' '):
            issues.append(f"Line {i}: trailing whitespace")

    return {"issues": issues, "count": len(issues)}

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Read code from stdin or argument
    code = sys.stdin.read() if not sys.argv[1:] else sys.argv[1]
    result = check_style(code)
    print(result)
```

### Shell Script Example

Create `scripts/lint.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Run linting on provided file

if [ -z "$1" ]; then
    echo "Usage: lint.sh <file>"
    exit 1
fi

ruff check "$1" 2>&1
```

<Note>
Scripts are executed with the skill directory as the working directory. The agent can pass arguments when executing scripts.
</Note>

## Adding References

References are documentation files the agent can load on demand.

### Example Reference

Create `references/style-guide.md`:

```markdown
# Python Style Guide

## Naming Conventions

- **Variables**: `snake_case`
- **Classes**: `PascalCase`
- **Constants**: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`

## Line Length

- Maximum 100 characters per line
- Break long lines at logical points

## Imports

- Standard library imports first
- Third-party imports second
- Local imports third
- Alphabetize within each group
```

## Validation Rules

Skills are validated when loaded. Here are the rules:

### Name Requirements

- Maximum 64 characters
- Lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only
- Cannot start or end with a hyphen
- No consecutive hyphens (`--`)
- Must match the directory name

### Field Limits

| Field | Max Length |
|-------|------------|
| name | 64 characters |
| description | 1024 characters |

### Valid Licenses

Common SPDX identifiers are accepted: `MIT`, `Apache-2.0`, `GPL-3.0`, `BSD-3-Clause`, etc.

## Organizing Multiple Skills

Create a directory containing multiple skill folders:

```
skills/
├── code-review/
│   ├── SKILL.md
│   ├── scripts/
│   └── references/
├── git-workflow/
│   ├── SKILL.md
│   ├── scripts/
│   └── references/
└── testing/
    ├── SKILL.md
    └── references/
```

Load all skills at once:

```python
from agno.skills import Skills, LocalSkills

skills = Skills(loaders=[LocalSkills("/path/to/skills")])
```
