This example shows how to enable tracing for a team. When tracing is enabled, all team operations, member agent runs, model calls, and tool executions are automatically captured and stored in your database.

<Steps>

  <Step title="Create a Python file">
    ```python basic_team_tracing.py
    from agno.agent import Agent
    from agno.db.sqlite import SqliteDb
    from agno.models.openai import OpenAIResponses
    from agno.team import Team
    from agno.tools.hackernews import HackerNewsTools
    from agno.tracing import setup_tracing

    # Set up database for traces
    db = SqliteDb(db_file="tmp/traces.db")

    # Enable tracing (call once at startup)
    setup_tracing(db=db)

    # Create member agent - no need to set tracing on each one!
    hackernews_agent = Agent(
        name="HackerNews Agent",
        model=OpenAIResponses(id="gpt-5.2"),
        tools=[HackerNewsTools()],
        instructions="You are a hacker news agent. Answer questions concisely.",
        markdown=True,
    )

    # Create team with the agent as a member
    team = Team(
        name="HackerNews Team",
        model=OpenAIResponses(id="gpt-5.2"),
        members=[hackernews_agent],
        instructions="You are a hacker news team. Use the HackerNews Agent to answer questions.",
        db=db,
    )

    # Run the team - traces are captured automatically
    team.print_response("What's trending on HackerNews?")

    # Query traces from the database
    traces, count = db.get_traces(team_id=team.id, limit=10)
    print(f"\nFound {count} traces for team '{team.name}'")
    for trace in traces:
        print(f"  - {trace.name}: {trace.duration_ms}ms ({trace.status})")
    ```

  <Step title="Install dependencies">
    ```bash
    uv pip install -U openai agno opentelemetry-api opentelemetry-sdk openinference-instrumentation-agno
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Export your OpenAI API key">
    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash Mac/Linux
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
    ```

    ```bash Windows
    $Env:OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run the team">
    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash Mac
    python basic_team_tracing.py
    ```

    ```bash Windows
    python basic_team_tracing.py
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
