title: Agent as Judge as Post-Hook
description: Using Agent as Judge evaluation as a post-hook for automatic evaluation
---

This example demonstrates using Agent as Judge evaluation as a post-hook, automatically evaluating every agent response.

<Steps>

  <Step title="Add the following code to your Python file">
    ```python agent_as_judge_post_hook.py
    from agno.agent import Agent
    from agno.db.sqlite import SqliteDb
    from agno.eval.agent_as_judge import AgentAsJudgeEval
    from agno.models.openai import OpenAIResponses

    # Setup database to persist eval results
    db = SqliteDb(db_file="tmp/agent_as_judge_post_hook.db")

    # Eval runs as post-hook, results saved to database
    agent_as_judge_eval = AgentAsJudgeEval(
        name="Response Quality Check",
        model=OpenAIResponses(id="gpt-5.2"),
        criteria="Response should be professional, well-structured, and provide balanced perspectives",
        scoring_strategy="numeric",
        threshold=7,
        db=db,
    )

    agent = Agent(
        model=OpenAIResponses(id="gpt-5.2"),
        instructions="Provide professional and well-reasoned answers.",
        post_hooks=[agent_as_judge_eval],
        db=db,
    )

    response = agent.run("What are the benefits of renewable energy?")
    print(response.content)

    # Query database for eval results
    print("Evaluation Results:")
    eval_runs = db.get_eval_runs()
    if eval_runs:
        latest = eval_runs[-1]
        if latest.eval_data and "results" in latest.eval_data:
            result = latest.eval_data["results"][0]
            print(f"Score: {result.get('score', 'N/A')}/10")
            print(f"Status: {'PASSED' if result.get('passed') else 'FAILED'}")
            print(f"Reason: {result.get('reason', 'N/A')[:200]}...")

    ```

  <Step title="Install dependencies">
    ```bash
    uv pip install -U agno openai
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Export your OpenAI API key">

    ```bash Mac/Linux
      export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
    ```

    ```bash Windows
      $Env:OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
    ```

  <Step title="Run the example">
    ```bash
    python agent_as_judge_post_hook.py
    ```
