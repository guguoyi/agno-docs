## What we're building

In this quickstart, you'll create a simple Agent that can understand and respond to questions. You'll see it work in seconds, then learn how to make it production-ready.

**[Agents](/basics/agents/overview) are programs where a language model controls the flow of execution.**

## Step 1: Install and configure

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Agno">

    Install Agno and your model provider SDK:

    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash Mac/Linux
    pip install agno openai
    ```

    ```bash Windows
    pip install agno openai
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

    <Note>
    You can use any model provider. For Claude, install `anthropic` instead of `openai`. See [all supported models](/integrations/models/overview).
    </Note>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Set your API key">

    Get your API key from your model provider and set it as an environment variable:

    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash Mac/Linux
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-***
    ```

    ```bash Windows
    setx OPENAI_API_KEY sk-***
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

    <Note>
    For Claude, use `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` instead. On Windows, you may need to restart your terminal after setting the environment variable.
    </Note>

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Create your first Agent

Create a file called `agent.py`:

```python agent.py
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat

# Create your Agent
agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o-mini"),
    instructions="You are a helpful AI assistant.",
    markdown=True,
)

# Run
agent.print_response("What is artificial intelligence?", stream=True)
```

## Step 3: Run your Agent

```bash
python agent.py
```

Your agent will process the input and stream its response directly to your terminal.

<Check>
**You've successfully created and run your first Agent.** In just a few lines of code, you have a working agent that can understand questions and generate responses.
</Check>

## What's next?

Now that you have a working agent, here are some ways to extend it:

### Add tools

Give your agent access to external tools via MCP (Model Context Protocol). MCP enables your agent to interact with external systems through a standardized interface.

In this example, we'll use the Agno MCP server:

```python agent.py
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.tools.mcp import MCPTools

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o-mini"),
     # Add the Agno MCP server to the Agent
    tools=[MCPTools(transport="streamable-http", url="https://docs.agno.com/mcp")],
    instructions="You are a helpful AI assistant.",
    markdown=True,
)
```

Learn more about [MCP tools](/basics/tools/mcp/overview) and [all available tools](/basics/tools/overview).

### Add short-term memory

Store conversation history in a database:

```python agent.py
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.db.sqlite import SqliteDb

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o-mini"),
    db=SqliteDb(db_file="agent.db"),  # Store conversations
    add_history_to_context=True,  # Remember previous messages
    instructions="You are a helpful AI assistant.",
    markdown=True,
)
```

Learn more about [sessions and memory](/basics/sessions/overview).

### Deploy as an API

Turn your agent into a production-ready API using [AgentOS](/agent-os/overview). Update your `agent.py`:

```python agent.py
from agno.os import AgentOS
from agno.agent import Agent

agent = Agent(...)

agent_os = AgentOS(agents=[agent])
app = agent_os.get_app()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    agent_os.serve(app="agent:app", reload=True)
```

Then run it:

```bash
python agent.py
```

This creates a FastAPI server with REST endpoints, streaming support, and a web interface.  Read more about [AgentOS](/agent-os/overview).

#### Connect to AgentOS Control Plane

Agno provides a web interface called the [AgentOS Control Plane](/agent-os/control-plane) that connects to your AgentOS. Use it to monitor, manage and test your agentic system.

1. Open [os.agno.com](https://os.agno.com) and sign in to your account
2. Click **"Add new OS"** in the top navigation bar
3. Select **"Local"** to connect to a local AgentOS running on your machine
4. Enter the endpoint URL (default is `http://localhost:8000`)
5. Give your AgentOS a descriptive name and click **"Connect"**

#### Chat with your Agent

Once connected, go to the `Chat` section in the sidebar and select your Agent. You can now interact with your agent through the web interface!
