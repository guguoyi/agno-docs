### Core Intelligence

- [**Model Agnostic**](/basics/models/overview): Works with any model provider so you can use your favorite LLMs.

- [**Type Safe**](/basics/input_output/overview): Enforce structured I/O through `input_schema` and `output_schema` for predictable, composable behavior.

- [**Dynamic Context Engineering**](/basics/context/overview): Inject variables, state, and retrieved data on the fly into context. Perfect for dependency-driven agents.

### Memory, Knowledge, and Persistence

- [**Persistent Storage**](/basics/storage/overview): Give your Agents, Teams, and Workflows a database to persist session history, state, and messages.

- [**User Memory**](/basics/memory/overview): Built-in memory system that allows Agents to recall user-specific context across sessions.

- [**Agentic RAG**](/basics/knowledge/content-db): Connect to 20+ vector stores (called **Knowledge** in Agno) with hybrid search + reranking out of the box.

- [**Culture (Collective Memory)**](/basics/culture/overview): Shared knowledge that compounds across agents and time.

### Execution & Control

- [**Human-in-the-Loop**](/basics/human-in-the-loop/overview): Native support for confirmations, manual overrides, and external tool execution.

- [**Guardrails**](/basics/guardrails/overview): Built-in safeguards for validation, security, and prompt protection.

- [**Agent Lifecycle Hooks**](/basics/hooks/overview): Pre- and post-hooks to validate or transform inputs and outputs.

- [**MCP Integration**](/basics/mcp/overview): First-class support for the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to connect Agents with external systems.

- [**Toolkits**](/basics/toolkits/overview): 113+ built-in toolkits with thousands of tools — ready for use across domains like data, code, web, and enterprise APIs.

### Runtime & Evaluation

- [**AgentOS Runtime**](/agent-os/overview): Pre-built FastAPI based runtime with SSE compatible endpoints, ready for production on day 1.

- [**AgentOS Control Plane (UI)**](/agent-os/control-plane): Integrated interface to visualize, monitor, and debug agent activity in real time.

- [**Natively Multimodal**](/basics/multimodal/overview): Agents can process and generate text, images, audio, video, and files.

- [**Evals**](/basics/evals/overview): Measure your Agents' Accuracy, Performance, and Reliability.

### Security & Privacy

- **Private by Design**: Runs entirely in your cloud. The UI connects directly to your AgentOS from your browser — no data is ever sent externally.

- **Data Governance**: Your data lives securely in your Agent database, with no external data sharing or vendor lock-in.

- **Access Control**: Role-based access (RBAC) and per-agent permissions to protect sensitive contexts and tools.

Every part of Agno is built for real-world deployment, where developer experience meets production performance.
