Agno turns agents into learning machines by combining them with Learning Stores. Learning Stores are persistent backends that capture user profiles, memories, and knowledge over time.

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.db.sqlite import SqliteDb
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIResponses

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIResponses(id="gpt-5.2"),
    db=SqliteDb(db_file="tmp/agents.db"),
    learning=True,
)
```

One line. Your agent now remembers users and improves over time.

## Learning Stores

Each store captures a different type of knowledge:

| Store | What it captures | Scope |
|-------|------------------|-------|
| **User Profile** | Structured facts (name, role, preferences) | Per user |
| **User Memory** | Unstructured observations from conversations | Per user |
| **Session Context** | Goals, plans, and progress for the current session | Per session |
| **Entity Memory** | Facts about external things (companies, projects, people) | Configurable |
| **Learned Knowledge** | Insights that transfer across users | Configurable |
| **Decision Log** | Decisions with reasoning for auditing and learning | Per agent |

Stores can be enabled individually or combined. Each implements the same protocol: `recall`, `process`, `build_context`, `get_tools`.

## Learning Modes

Control how and when the agent learns:

| Mode | How it works |
|------|--------------|
| **Always** | Extraction runs automatically after each response |
| **Agentic** | Agent receives tools and decides what to save |
| **Propose** | Agent proposes learnings, you approve before saving |

## Namespaces

Some stores support configurable sharing scope via `namespace`:

| Namespace | Who can access |
|-----------|----------------|
| `"user"` | Only the current user |
| `"global"` | Everyone (default) |
| Custom | Explicit grouping (e.g., `"engineering"`, `"sales_west"`) |

## Maintenance

The Curator keeps memories healthy:
```python
lm = agent.get_learning_machine()

# Remove memories older than 90 days
lm.curator.prune(user_id="alice", max_age_days=90)

# Remove duplicates
lm.curator.deduplicate(user_id="alice")
```
