Learning modes control when and how a Learning Machine captures information. Each store can use a different mode.

| Mode | How it works | Tradeoff |
|------|--------------|----------|
| **Always** | Extraction runs automatically after each response | Extra LLM call per interaction |
| **Agentic** | Agent receives tools and decides what to save | May miss implicit information |
| **Propose** | Agent proposes learnings, user confirms before saving | Requires user interaction |

## Always Mode

Extraction happens automatically in the background. No agent tools involved.
```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.db.postgres import PostgresDb
from agno.learn import LearningMachine, LearningMode, UserProfileConfig
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIResponses

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIResponses(id="gpt-5.2"),
    db=PostgresDb(db_url="postgresql+psycopg://ai:ai@localhost:5532/ai"),
    learning=LearningMachine(
        user_profile=UserProfileConfig(mode=LearningMode.ALWAYS),
    ),
)

# Profile info extracted automatically - no tool calls visible
agent.print_response(
    "I'm Alice Chen, but please call me Ali.",
    user_id="alice@example.com",
)
```

Best for: User Profile, User Memory, Session Context

## Agentic Mode

The agent receives tools and decides when to save.
```python
from agno.learn import LearningMachine, LearningMode, UserProfileConfig

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIResponses(id="gpt-5.2"),
    db=db,
    learning=LearningMachine(
        user_profile=UserProfileConfig(mode=LearningMode.AGENTIC),
    ),
)

# Agent decides to call update_user_profile tool
agent.print_response(
    "Remember that I prefer dark mode interfaces.",
    user_id="alice@example.com",
)
```

Best for: Learned Knowledge, Entity Memory, Decision Log

### Tools by Store

| Store | Tools |
|-------|-------|
| User Profile | `update_user_profile` |
| User Memory | `save_user_memory`, `delete_user_memory` |
| Entity Memory | `search_entities`, `create_entity`, `update_entity`, `add_fact`, `add_event` |
| Learned Knowledge | `search_learnings`, `save_learning` |
| Decision Log | `log_decision`, `record_outcome`, `search_decisions` |

## Propose Mode

The agent proposes learnings. User must confirm before saving.
```python
from agno.learn import LearningMachine, LearningMode, LearnedKnowledgeConfig

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIResponses(id="gpt-5.2"),
    db=db,
    learning=LearningMachine(
        knowledge=knowledge,
        learned_knowledge=LearnedKnowledgeConfig(mode=LearningMode.PROPOSE),
    ),
)

# Agent proposes, user confirms
agent.print_response(
    "That's a great insight about API rate limits - we should remember that.",
    user_id="alice@example.com",
)
```

Best for: High-stakes knowledge, regulated environments, quality control

## Combining Modes

Use different modes for different stores:
```python
from agno.learn import (
    LearningMachine,
    LearningMode,
    UserProfileConfig,
    UserMemoryConfig,
    LearnedKnowledgeConfig,
)

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIResponses(id="gpt-5.2"),
    db=db,
    learning=LearningMachine(
        user_profile=UserProfileConfig(mode=LearningMode.ALWAYS),     # Automatic
        user_memory=UserMemoryConfig(mode=LearningMode.ALWAYS),       # Automatic
        learned_knowledge=LearnedKnowledgeConfig(mode=LearningMode.AGENTIC),  # Agent-driven
    ),
)
```

## Defaults by Store

| Store | Default mode | Reason |
|-------|--------------|--------|
| User Profile | Always | Names and preferences should be captured consistently |
| User Memory | Always | Observations accumulate passively |
| Session Context | Always | Session state needs continuous tracking |
| Entity Memory | Agentic | Agent builds knowledge graph as needed |
| Learned Knowledge | Agentic | Agent decides what insights are worth saving |
| Decision Log | Agentic | Agent logs significant decisions explicitly |

## Choosing a Mode

| Scenario | Mode |
|----------|------|
| Capture user names and preferences | Always |
| Build user memory automatically | Always |
| Track session progress | Always |
| Agent-driven knowledge capture | Agentic |
| Build entity knowledge graphs | Agentic |
| Audit agent decisions | Agentic |
| High-value collective knowledge | Propose |
| Compliance-sensitive learning | Propose |
