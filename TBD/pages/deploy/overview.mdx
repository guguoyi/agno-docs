Once you have built and configured your AgentOS locally, the next step is taking it to production. AgentOS exposes a FastAPI application under the hood, which means you are free to deploy it to any infrastructure you prefer, including container services, serverless architectures, Kubernetes, or a simple virtual machine.

The most reliable and convenient way to deploy a FastAPI application to production is as a containerized service. To make this easy, we provide ready-to-use templates for popular platforms including AWS ECS and Railway with more coming soon. If you prefer complete control, you can also turn your AgentOS into a minimal production repository with just a few files.

Here, we'll walk you through the entire process: starting from a plain Python codebase, converting it into a production-ready FastAPI service, containerizing it with Docker, and deploying it to the platform of your choice.

## Preparing your Python project

A minimal AgentOS project usually looks like this:

```agentos
├── agents/
├── scripts/
├── pyproject.toml
├── requirements.txt
├── Dockerfile
└── app/main.py # Houses your AgentOS app
```

Your agents, teams and workflows are automatically mounted and ready to serve. As long as they are added to your AgentOS instance.

## Adding a production ready Dockerfile

Here is a minimal Dockerfile for deploying AgentOS:

```docker
FROM agnohq/python:3.12

ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 \
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt pyproject.toml ./
RUN uv pip sync requirements.txt --system

COPY . .

EXPOSE 8000

CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]

```

This creates a clean, production-friendly container image.

## Testing locally

Build and run the container using the following commands from the root of your project:

Prerequisites:

- [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Python 3.12](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Agno](https://github.com/agno-agi/agno)

```bash
docker buildx build --load -t agentos .
```

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 agentos
```

Visit `http://localhost:8000/docs` to see your AgentOS documentation. Here, you can see the endpoints for your AgentOS FastAPI application.

## Deployment options

You can deploy AgentOS anywhere that supports Docker containers.  
To get started quickly, we recommend using one of our deployment templates.  
Learn more about them [here](/deploy/templates).

### AWS

A production-ready configuration running entirely on AWS:

- Multi-architecture Docker builds
- Amazon ECR for container registry
- ECS Fargate service for running your container
- Application Load Balancer with HTTPS
- Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL)

Check out our [AWS template](/templates/agent-infra-aws/introduction) for more information.

---

### Cloud providers

AgentOS can run on any cloud provider that supports Docker containers. For example:

- Google Cloud Run
- AWS App Runner
- Azure Container Apps

---

### Railway

A simple and fast deployment method. Railway:

- Builds your Dockerfile
- Manages environment variables
- Provides a public HTTPS domain automatically

Check out our [Railway template](/templates/agent-infra-railway/introduction) for more information.

---

### Hosting Platforms

Similar to Railway, you can use other platforms that accept a Dockerfile, manage environment variables, and host your service with minimal configuration.  
Templates for these are coming soon:

- [Modal](https://modal.com/)
- [Render](https://render.com/)
- [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/)
- [Fly.io](https://fly.io/)
