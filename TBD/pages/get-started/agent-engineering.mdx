### Core Intelligence

- [**Model Agnostic Architecture**](/models/overview): Seamlessly integrate with any [LLM provider](/models/overview), enabling flexibility across the model ecosystem for your agentic systems.

- [**Type-Safe I/O**](/input-output/overview): Enforce structured input and output schemas through [type-safe interfaces](/input-output/overview) for predictable, composable agentic behavior.

- [**Dynamic Context Engineering**](/context/overview): Advanced [context injection](/context/overview) capabilities that dynamically inject variables, state, and retrieved data into agent context, optimized for dependency-driven multi-agent architectures.

### Memory, Knowledge, and Persistence

- [**Persistent Storage**](/database/overview): Enterprise-grade [database integration](/database/overview) enabling agents, teams, and workflows to persist session history, state, and messages with full transactional support.

- [**User Memory**](/memory/overview): Sophisticated [memory system](/memory/overview) that enables agents to maintain and recall user-specific context across sessions, enhancing personalization in agentic interactions.

- [**Agentic RAG**](/knowledge/concepts/content-db): Production-ready [agentic retrieval-augmented generation](/knowledge/concepts/content-db) with support for 20+ vector stores (called **Knowledge** in Agno), featuring hybrid search and intelligent reranking capabilities.

- [**Culture (Collective Memory)**](/culture/overview): Shared knowledge architecture that compounds across [multi-agent systems](/culture/overview), enabling collective intelligence and organizational learning.

### Execution & Control

- [**Human-in-the-Loop**](/hitl/overview): Native [human-in-the-loop](/hitl/overview) support for confirmations, manual overrides, and external tool execution, ensuring human oversight in critical agentic workflows.

- [**Guardrails**](/guardrails/overview): Comprehensive [safeguard system](/guardrails/overview) for validation, security, and prompt protection across agentic applications.

- [**Agent Lifecycle Hooks**](/hooks/overview): Extensible [hook system](/hooks/overview) with pre- and post-execution hooks to validate, transform, and monitor agent inputs and outputs.

- [**MCP Integration**](/tools/mcp/overview): First-class support for the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](/tools/mcp/overview), enabling seamless integration between agentic systems and external services.

- [**Toolkits**](/tools/toolkits/overview): Extensive library of 120+ [pre-built toolkits](/tools/toolkits/overview) with thousands of tools, ready for deployment across domains including data processing, code generation, web automation, and enterprise API integration.

### Runtime & Evaluation

- [**AgentOS Runtime**](/agent-os/overview): Production-ready [FastAPI-based runtime](/agent-os/overview) with Server-Sent Events (SSE) compatible endpoints, designed for enterprise deployment from day one.

- [**AgentOS Control Plane**](/agent-os/control-plane): Integrated [control plane interface](/agent-os/control-plane) for real-time visualization, monitoring, and debugging of agentic system activity across agents, teams, and workflows.

- [**Natively Multimodal**](/multimodal/overview): Built-in [multimodal capabilities](/multimodal/overview) enabling agents to process and generate text, images, audio, video, and files within unified agentic workflows.

- [**Evaluation Framework**](/evals/overview): Comprehensive [evaluation system](/evals/overview) for measuring agent accuracy, performance, and reliability across diverse agentic applications.

### Security & Privacy

- **Private by Design**: Enterprise-grade privacy architecture where all agentic systems run entirely within your infrastructure. The control plane connects directly to your AgentOS from your browser — no data is ever transmitted to external services.

- **Data Governance**: Complete data sovereignty with secure storage in your agent database, eliminating external data sharing and vendor lock-in while maintaining full control over sensitive agentic workflows.

{/* - **Access Control**: Enterprise [role-based access control (RBAC)](/agent-os/security) and granular per-agent permissions to protect sensitive contexts, tools, and multi-agent system configurations. */}

Agno is architected for enterprise-scale agentic AI deployment, where world-class developer experience converges with production-grade performance, reliability, and security.
