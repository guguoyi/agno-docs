## What is Agno?

Agno is the complete stack for multi-agent systems: an SDK for building agents, a runtime for serving them, and a control plane for managing them in production.

Everything runs in your cloud. No data leaves your environment.

| Layer | What it does |
|-------|--------------|
| **SDK** | Build agents, teams, and workflows with memory, knowledge, guardrails, and 100+ integrations. |
| **Runtime** | Serve your system as a stateless FastAPI application. |
| **Control Plane** | Monitor and manage via the [AgentOS UI](https://os.agno.com). |

## Why Agno?

Most teams cobble together LLM calls, custom orchestration, and third-party monitoring. Agno replaces that patchwork with a unified stack optimized for agent workloads.

## Quick Example

An agent with MCP tools, persistent state, and a production-ready API:

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.db.sqlite import SqliteDb
from agno.models.anthropic import Claude
from agno.os import AgentOS
from agno.tools.mcp import MCPTools

agent = Agent(
    name="Agno Agent",
    model=Claude(id="claude-sonnet-4-5"),
    db=SqliteDb(db_file="agno.db"),
    tools=[MCPTools(url="https://docs.agno.com/mcp")],
    add_history_to_context=True,
    markdown=True,
)

agent_os = AgentOS(agents=[agent])
app = agent_os.get_app()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    agent_os.serve(app="agno_agent:app", reload=True)
```

Run this and connect to [os.agno.com](https://os.agno.com) to chat with your agent:
