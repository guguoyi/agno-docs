## What is Agno?

**A Python SDK for building agents that learn and improve with every interaction.**

Most agents are stateless. They reason, respond, forget. Session history helps, but they're exactly as capable on day 1000 as they were on day 1.

Agno agents are different. They remember users across sessions, accumulate knowledge across conversations, and learn from decisions. Insights from one user benefit everyone.

Everything runs in your cloud. Your data never leaves your environment.

## Quick Example
```python {8}
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.db.sqlite import SqliteDb
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIResponses

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIResponses(id="gpt-5.2"),
    db=SqliteDb(db_file="tmp/agents.db"),
    learning=True,
)
```

One line. Now your Agno agent remembers users, accumulates knowledge, and improves over time.

## Production Stack

Agno provides the complete infrastructure:

| Layer | What it does |
|-------|--------------|
| **SDK** | Build agents with learning, tools, knowledge, and guardrails |
| **Runtime** | Run in production using [AgentOS](/agent-os/introduction) |
| **Control Plane** | Monitor and manage via the [AgentOS UI](https://os.agno.com) |
