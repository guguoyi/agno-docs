Agno provides a complete set of tools for building:

- **Agents** with memory, knowledge, session management, and advanced features like human-in-the-loop, guardrails, dynamic context management and best-in-class MCP support.
- **Multi-Agent Teams** that operate autonomously under a team leader that maintains shared state and context. Perfect for use cases where the scope exceeds beyond a single agent.
- **Step-based Workflows** for controlled, deterministic execution. Steps can be Agents, Teams, or regular python functions that run sequentially, in parallel, in loops, branches, or conditionally.

Agno also provides a ready-to-use FastAPI app (**called the AgentOS**) for running your agents, teams and workflows in production. Stateless, horizontally scalable and designed for scale, the AgentOS gives you a major head start in building your AI product.

## Example

Here’s an example of an Agent that connects to an MCP server, manages conversation state in a database, is served using a FastAPI application that you can chat using the [AgentOS UI](https://os.agno.com).

```python agno_agent.py lines
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.db.sqlite import SqliteDb
from agno.models.anthropic import Claude
from agno.os import AgentOS
from agno.tools.mcp import MCPTools

# ************* Create Agent *************
agno_agent = Agent(
    name="Agno Agent",
    model=Claude(id="claude-sonnet-4-5"),
    db=SqliteDb(db_file="agno.db"),
    tools=[MCPTools(transport="streamable-http", url="https://docs.agno.com/mcp")],
    add_history_to_context=True,
    markdown=True,
)

# ************* Create AgentOS *************
agent_os = AgentOS(agents=[agno_agent])
app = agent_os.get_app()

# ************* Run AgentOS *************
if __name__ == "__main__":
    agent_os.serve(app="agno_agent:app", reload=True)
```

## AgentOS - Production Runtime for Multi-Agent Systems

Building Agents is easy, running them is hard, and that's where the AgentOS comes in. AgentOS is a high-performance runtime for serving multi-agent systems in production. Key features include:

1. **Pre-built FastAPI app**: AgentOS ships with a ready-to-use FastAPI app for running your agents, teams, and workflows. This gives you a major head start in building your AI product.

2. **Integrated Control Plane**: The [AgentOS UI](https://os.agno.com) connects directly to your runtime, letting you test, monitor, and manage your system in real time, giving you unmatched control over your system.

3. **Private by Design**: AgentOS runs entirely in your cloud, ensuring complete data privacy. No data ever leaves your system. This is ideal for security-conscious enterprises.

Here's what the [AgentOS UI](https://os.agno.com) looks like in action:

## The Complete Agentic Solution

Agno provides the complete solution for companies building agentic systems:

- The fastest framework for building agents, multi-agent teams and agentic workflows.
- A ready-to-use FastAPI app that gets you building AI products on day one.
- A control plane for testing, monitoring and managing your system.

We bring a novel architecture that no other framework provides, your AgentOS runs securely in your cloud, and the control plane connects directly to it from your browser. You don't need to send data to any external services or pay retention costs, you get complete privacy and control.

## Getting started

If you're new to Agno, follow the [quickstart](/getting-started/quickstart) to build your first Agent and run it using the AgentOS.

After that, checkout the [use-cases gallery](/examples/use-cases/overview) and build real-world applications with Agno.
